You can run the server using Python 2.7 and all the requirments in the requirments.txt

First create a venv with python2.7 and pip install the requirements, then use the run.sh shell script to start the server and the serial server.

The server runs on localhost:5000, and you can use a reverse proxy if you want to host it on Apache, nginx or the like, but dev is fine for our purposes as we dont need to support many users.
